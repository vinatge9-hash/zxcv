Shore Coffee - Phase 2 Build

Overview:
- Four pages: index.html (Home), menu.html (Menu), about.html (About), and contact.html (Contact Us).
- Tailwind CSS is used via CDN for styling. All styling is done with Tailwind classes directly in HTML.
- Placeholder images use the required format: src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1554830435-18a3bdbed18d?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w3ODkyNDZ8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwyfHwuLi58ZW58MHwwfHx8MTc1ODQ2MjUwOHww&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=80&w=1080".
- Accessibility: semantic HTML, descriptive alt attributes, proper headings, and meta tags.
- Interactions: all interactive elements have transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out. Page fade-in on load. Scroll reveal for sections. Hover effects for buttons and cards.

How to customize:
- Change text in the HTML files to reflect your brand voice.
- Update image placeholders with real images when ready, keeping the same alt text for accessibility.
- Adjust colors by swapping Tailwind utility classes (e.g., bg-amber-500, text-amber-400).
- Update location in the footer or contact page to Hyderabad, Telangana, India (as placeholder).

Deployment:
- Upload the generated four HTML files to your hosting provider.
- Ensure that Tailwind CDN is allowed by the host or replace with a local build if needed.
